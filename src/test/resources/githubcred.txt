****how we integrate java project with jenkins and run using bat file:

create lib folder in project location/path
need to put all required jar files for this project  in this floder[selenium-java ,testNG, chromedriver etc..]
create one text file[ru.bat] and inside we need to provide 4-5 lines of batch commands
now we can just run this batch file to run our project 
-now run this batch file with the help of jenkins by integration
[jenkins-manage jenkins-global tool configuration-add the JDK[we have to provide JAVA_HOME] and we need to provide path from environment variables JAVA_HOME]
same git also we need to set and same maven path also we need to set and save it...
create new job: click on new item(sample project-freestyle project-ok)
go to project-configure-give description-check use custom workspace from advanced- and put the project path..build-select execute windows batch command option[we need to provide batch
commands 4-5 lines whatever we have in batch file] and apply and save
project is ready and click on build now...we can see output in console window

****how to integrate maven github project with jenkins and how we can set parameters in jenkins ans how we can pass parameters

source code management-select git and provide path and credntials

goals and options- clean install[here we can pass parameters but hardcoded also to our testcase][we have to specify like ..clean install -DxmlFiles=$XML -Dbrowser=$browser -Durl=$URL]after 
specifying all parameters from first secton in configure tab
click on apply and save and build now..now we can see build with parameters option

->if we want to pass parameters..from first section in configure tab ..select this is parametorized and provide string parameter and choice parametrers whicever we want..
